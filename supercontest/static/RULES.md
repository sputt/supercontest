## Scoring

* For each matchup, a line will be set at the number of points the favored team is expected to beat the underdog by.
* Example: The line is 6, 49ers over Patriots. If you pick the 49ers, and they win by a touchdown (7), or more, you got the pick correct. If the 49ers win by 5, or anything less than 6 (including a Patriots win), you got the pick incorrect. If the 49ers win by 6 exactly, your pick is a push.
* A correct pick is `1.0` point. An incorrect pick is `0.0` points. A push is `0.5` points.
* You get to pick 5 teams every week of the regular season.
* The lines are set deliberately to split bets, averaging close to the same 50/50 chance as a coin toss. Historically, if you average 3 picks correct out of 5 weekly, you are going to easily end the season in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. 60% is good for Vegas.

## Picking

* All times are PT.
* **An asterisk next to a team name means that they are the home team for that matchup.**
* Lines for the upcoming week will be posted Wednesday between 5pm and midnight.
* You have until Saturday night at midnight to place your picks.
* If you want to pick a team playing in the Thursday game, you have until kickoff to place it.
* To place picks, simply click the desired teams on the `Matchups` tab. The `Submit` button will appear at the bottom. The picks are not committed until you click this.
* Picks that have been submitted to the server are dark blue. Picks that you are moving around in the frontend, but have not submitted yet, are light blue.
* You may see the current state of your picks, and your picks alone, on the `Picks` tab. You may also see them on the `Matchups` tab, overlaid with the games and realtime scores.
* At midnight on Saturday, all of your picks will be locked and published. You can now view everyone's picks on the `Picks` tab.

## Logistics

* The UI updates in realtime. Refresh to see new scores.
* Your picks will be blue until the games start. Once begun, an active pick will show red or green, indicating correct/incorrect *if the game were to end right then*.
* The leaderboard and corresponding graphs follow the same logic. They show point totals for the current state of all games, as if they were finished.

## Payment

> This section is not related to the game. We are not a gambling site.

* The paid league is $50.
* $2 of each $50 goes to the end-of-season party in Hermosa Beach. Fly to LA for your hard-earned beer.
* The other $48 of each $50 goes to winnings. We are not pocketing any of the dues. The service is free.
* You must pay by week 3.
* If you pick week 2 then you are officially playing, and we will try to collect from you.
* The top 25% ranked players get paid.
* **A $10 weekly prize will be awarded to anyone who gets all 5 picks correctly**. If no one goes 5-0 then the prize will carry over to the next week, accumulating another $10. If multiple people get 5-0, then the current prize total will be split evenly among them. If no one goes 5-0 on the final week of the regular season, then the current prize total gets added to the 1st place prize.
