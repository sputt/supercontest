FRONTEND FEATURES

* Backfill data from week 1.
* Fetch the lines for week 3.

PICK FORM

* Account login and authentication. Probably basic flask auth in the session.

* Once they can login, they can click inside matchups to select. 5 max. You have to unclick
  one to click another.
* Set a cutoff time. Show it on the frontend.
* Email the person after the picks are cutoff.
* Delete all the other flask login and pick form stuff that was already in the app.

MEDIUM TERM

* Rewrite the jinja logic in javascript? Yes.
* Figure out how it flushes week to week. Probably will have a separate route for each week, so
  people can reference back. This flush will also call fetch_lines, and will swap over once they're
  available. This can probably be manual for now, done by me on wed nights.
* Add text field on frontend somewherewhich says "what would make this app better?" and types "petty's mom"
  over and over no matter what keystrokes you enter.
* Add checkbox somewhere which says "I am playing this week under protest."
* Add leaderboard page and hyperlink it from the main view.
* Database backup scheme.
* tox lint and flake8, no pytest yet.
* Use flask-bcrypt http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/configuration.html
* Use flask-cache if the app is slow: http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/views.html
* Use flask-assets to bundle jsmin and jquerymin and stuff http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/static.html
* Use alembic for migrations http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/storing.html. Read all alembic docs.
