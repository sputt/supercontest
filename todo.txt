RIGHT NOW

* Get the jinja form to extend the main layout template properly. Make it work with picks.
* Account login and authentication. Probably basic flask auth in the session.

* Host the service publicly on https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ (or AWS EC2 if the other sucks).
  Make sure there's a db backup scheme in place, even if simple.

FRONTEND FEATURES

* Integrate the frontend. One view for everything. Play with rendering for current spoofed db. Use flask_table.
* Default to current week, dropdown for previous.
* Main page should colorize for in-progress games. It should also add the asterisk back to home team.
* Add leaderboard page and hyperlink it from the main view.
* There is python in render_lines_with_scores which compares and renders the scores/picks,
  coloring them green etc. Convert that to javascript.

TIMING FEATURES

* Figure out how it flushes week to week. Probably will have a separate route for each week, so
  people can reference back. This flush will also call fetch_lines, and will swap over once they're
  available. This can probably be manual for now, done by me on wed nights.
